Maptime brings experts, beginners, and the curious together all for the sake of spatial learning. Our goal for the Seattle branch of maptime is to connect geospatial professionals with those who desire to learn more about maps and spatial data.

**We are** an organization oriented towards beginners and those with *zero* knowledge of the topics we discuss. **We are** a welcoming community, ready to set aside our professional selves in favor of collective learning and undestanding. **We are** committed to individual learning, and aim to devote time to every person who attends meetings to ensure proper understanding.

**We are not** experts, and do not know everything. Let's learn together!

Yay maptime!
