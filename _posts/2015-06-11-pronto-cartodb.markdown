title: "Bike Maps with CartoDB"
---



We're going to map data from [Pronto Cycle Share](https://www.prontocycleshare.com/), a Seattle bike share program, with a tool called [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/). You don't need to ride a bike to do this tutorial. Oh, and if you've never made a map or web map, that's cool too.

We aren't going to show you how to make one type of map in this tutorial. Instead, we'll show you how to get access to CartoDB, connect to data and explain what the provided data means. At that point, the rest is up to you and your fellow mappers to define what types of maps you want to make. Share and collaborate! **Email seattle@maptime.io with a link to your map, code snippet or screenshot and we'll add it to the examples on this page.**

## Pronto Cycle Share
Why Pronto data? Well, the program is local, the data is spatial, generated by real bikers and freely available. Plus we think Seattle needs more transportation options. Getting people to explore _how things are_ is a great way to raise awareness and drive (bike?) toward a better future.

## CartoDB
The motto at CartoDB is "Maps for the Web, made easy". Making maps is not easy, but it doesn't have to be hard either. CartoDB supplies tools to connect and style data for maps in a web browser. Here at MaptimeSEA, we've found this to be a very fast way to explore and visualize spatial data on the web. Plus, CartoDB is built on and contributes to open source projects. And it's worth mentioning that they have a free tier.

# Objectives
1. Support fellow mappers
2. Have a good time
3. Grok the data
4. Setup CartoDB
5. Connect to data
6. Explore and visualize
7. Show and tell

# Grok Data
Before we get started, we need to understand the data we have so we can frame questions we want to answer with it.

## Origin

## Fields

# Setup
If you don't already have an account, visit the [signup page](https://cartodb.com/signup) and create one. Once you're in, you will land on a page that looks something like this:

You're ready to rock!

# Connect
Okay, so now we need some data. Navigate to *Your datasets*
![Navigate](/img/tut_carto_02.png)

You are now in the dataset view. We need data. Click **NEW DATASET** to load data.
![Datasets](/img/tut_carto_03.png)

CartoDB gives you lots of ways to connect to data. Today, we'll connect via URL. Drop this link to [station_data_1min_interval.csv](https://github.com/MaptimeSEA/prontodata/blob/master/data_processed/station_data_1min_interval.csv) into the *Enter a URL* field:
![connect](/img/tut_carto_04.png)

BOOM! You've got data yes you do. This is what it might look like:

## Off to the Races
We've got data. Let's go.
